Writing assembler software, for assembly language, writing this project in C.
The project include the next items:
	1.	Source files of the program (files with suffix .c or .h).
	2.	Running file (complexed and linked) for Ubuntu system.
	3.	A makefile. The compilation must be with the gcc compiler and flags: -Wall -ansi-pedantic. All messages sent by the compiler should be filtered out, so that         the program will be folded without any comments or warnings.
	4.	running examples (input & output):
	    a.	Input files in assembly language, and the output files created from the assembly of the assembler on these input files. The use of the variety of actions           and types of characters of the assembly language must be demonstrated.
	    b.	Assembly-language input files that demonstrate a wide range of assembly error types (and therefore do not create output files), and screen prints that               show the assembler's error messages.
